## Development
Run the following command to get torproxy's source code and switch your working directory to the torproxy repository
```
git clone github.com/okkur/torproxy && cd torproxy
```

Then run the following command to download the dependencies to your local cache
```
go mod download
```

Do not forget to install the Tor itself on your machine too since torproxy needs that to operate correctly.
