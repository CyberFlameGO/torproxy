# Vision
Torproxy is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
Providing a fast and simple way to proxy your http requests through the onion network

Our detailed items:
  * Simple and minimal config
* Proxy multiple hosts to a single endpoint

## Core Concept
Torproxy's core concept is to provide a simple way to proxy your http requsts using Caddy without needing to write complex logics and config

## General Aim
Our aim is to provide a secure and easy way to access onion network on any device.

## Communication
A lot of discussion about Torproxy happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Torproxy becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Torproxy project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
