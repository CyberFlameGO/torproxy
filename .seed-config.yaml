  usageExample: |
    Note: The `master` branch is using [Caddy v2](https://caddyserver.com/), if you
    want to use Torproxy with previous caddy versions, check the `caddy-v1` branch.

    If you want Torproxy to start a fresh instance of Tor, you need to install Tor
    on your machine. Take a look at the [Tor download instructions](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

    You can get torproxy as a plugin on Caddy's `v1` [build server](https://caddyserver.com/download).

    Or install torproxy's `v2` version using `go get`:
    ```
    go get go.okkur.org/torproxy/cmd/torproxy
    ```

    Create a config file like the example below. For more information about the
    available config options, check the [Configuration](/docs/configuration.md) page.
    ```
    example.test {
      torproxy example.test somewhereonthe.onion 
    }
    ```

    Now you can run torproxy:
    ```
    torproxy -conf tor.test
    ```

docs:
  development: |
    Run the following command to get torproxy's source code and switch your working directory to the torproxy repository
    ```
    git clone github.com/okkur/torproxy && cd torproxy
    ```

    Then run the following command to build torproxy
    ```
    make build
    ```

    Do not forget to install Tor itself on your machine since torproxy needs that to operate correctly.
